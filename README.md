# logic-99

Me working through [99 Prolog Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/index.html) using Clojure's [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic). Since I don't really know what I'm doing, critical feedback on how to effectively and idiomatically apply **core.logic** to these problems is more than welcome. I'll probably poke through them very slowly as time permits.

## Usage

Well, there's not much to use. `lein test` to run the tests. Otherwise, take a look at `src/logic_99/core.clj`.
